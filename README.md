Usage: localvault [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  localvault - A command line utility to generate random passwords for the given
  username & key. It generates random passwords on the fly using pre-defined
  encryption algorithm and store locally to access them later. It saves you
  from not storing your username/passwords on the third party storage and
  being hacked at the end. It allows to be your own master where your secrets
  are completely secret to you.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add     Add a new username/password tagged with the given key.
  cloud   Option to configure cloud account to backup your secrets. [ Work in Progress ]
  delete  Delete the username/password tagged with the given key if any.
  get     Fetch the username/password tagged with the given key if any.
  init    Perform the inital setup required to save your secrets.
  list    List all the stored username/passwords.
  
```

Any username/password record requires a key to be tagged with. The key can be any random string and will be used later to access the username/password record. Internally **localvault** manages its own database to store username/password.
